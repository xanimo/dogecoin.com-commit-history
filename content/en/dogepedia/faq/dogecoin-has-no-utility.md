Oh yes it does, and it always had. In fact, one could say it is one of the few cryptocurrencies that has been used for its main purpose from day one. Dogecoin was first meant to be a joke - and it served and will serve this purpose very well - but it almost immediately became a means to tip and encourage others to go and achieve something - the Dogecoin car, the Jamaican bobsled team, the water wells in Kenya, and many more crazy initiatives the community supported over the years. As a tipping currency, thanks to its low fees and speed of transactions in comparison to competing chains for a long part of its existence, Dogecoin has never stopped working for its intended use. 

Over the years, it became possible to use Dogecoin and spend it in online stores. The past 2 years have seen an explosion in the adoption, with Dogecoin payment integrations provided by third parties like Bitpay and Coinbase and several providers providing prepaid cards supporting Dogecoin as a funding source. Shops can also integrate directly with the Dogecoin blockchain, and the Foundation, alongside the ecosystem of developers, is planning to facilitate this further by  creating libraries that will streamline and standardize implementations.

Development is ongoing to enhance Dogecoin and make it fullfill its original promises while being competitive with other cryptos - and thus find new purposes and uses.
