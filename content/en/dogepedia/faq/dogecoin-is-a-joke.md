Dogecoin was born as a joke - and this side of it, its sense of fun, should never go away. This post should get inspiration mostly from Sporklin's and Billy's statements on the topic, I believe. Sporklin, a staunch defender of Dogecoin, dedicated several posts to answer this statement, at the same time contextualizing and using it as a point of strength.
