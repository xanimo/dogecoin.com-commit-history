Dogs should wear no hats, and Doge is a dog, after all. The annual issuance is needed to pay miners and keep the network secure. Other chains, like Bitcoin, which theoretically will see their yearly issuance stop completely in 2140, will need to find a way to secure their network at that time (if it will still exist) - or they will need to change completely the design of their consensus mechanism. 

Other PoS cryptos also have unlimited supply - but nobody talks about it, for some reason.
