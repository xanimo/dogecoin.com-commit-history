Oh, yes it does - and it always has!  

Dogecoin’s primary purpose has always been to be used as a currency, and since it was forked from Litecoin and then reforked from Bitcoin — with changed parameters to make it more suitable as a cryptocurrency — Dogecoin inherited already feature-complete code bases. So, for many years, instead of having new shiny features, the development team worked mostly as maintainers of what was already there. Not once, in its history, Dogecoin did *not* have a group of developers working on it. 

In the future, the plan is to focus more efforts and resources to enhance Dogecoin so that it fulfills its aim to become a currency of the People. This will require a combination of part-time contributors, volunteers, but also full-time staff including developers and engineers.   

The Dogecoin Foundation’s [Trailmap](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/trailmap/) lists various projects as the ecosystem works towards its shared aim of becoming a currency for the People, by the People! This Trailmap is not authoritative, but an indication of where to go that is open for community feedback.

Even though a lot of actual work is done outside of this repository, some of the development efforts can be followed on Github in the [**Dogecoin Core repository**](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin). [**r/dogecoindev**](https://reddit.com/r/dogecoindev) on reddit is another good channel to discuss everything around Dogecoin's development and interact with the developers.
