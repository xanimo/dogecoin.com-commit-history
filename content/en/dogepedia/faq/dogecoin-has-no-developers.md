Oh yes it does, and it always had. Just, since Dogecoin main purpose has been to be a currency since its birth, and since it was forked from Litecoin and then reforked from Bitcoin, with changed parameters to make it more suitable as a cryptocurrency, it means it inherited already feature-complete code bases. So, for many years, instead of having new shiny features, the development team worked mostly as maintainers of what was already there. Not once, in its history, Dogecoin did not have a group of developers working on it.

In the future, the plan is to focus more efforts and resources to enhance Dogecoin, and make it fullfill its aim to become a crypto of the people also in its technical implementation. This will require a combination of part time contributors, volunteers, but also full time developers and engineers. Alongside, the foundation and the advisors will provide a "roadmap" to aim at possible goals: roadmap that will never be authoritative or normative, but an indication of where to go.
