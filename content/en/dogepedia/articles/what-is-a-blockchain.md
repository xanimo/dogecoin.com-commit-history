A blockchain is a digital distributed ledger that is used as a system for validating and recording transaction information. This digital ledger of transactions is duplicated and distributed throughout an entire network of computers connected to the blockchain.  

The Dogecoin blockchain consists of thousands of computers – called [nodes](/dogepedia/articles/what-is-a-node) – meaning that transaction information is not stored in one centralised place. Instead, Dogecoin blockchain information is stored across thousands of nodes, and is why cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin are often referred to as being *decentralised*. 

When a Dogecoin transaction is made, the information regarding the transaction is stored in what is a called a **block**, which is then distributed to the other nodes throughout the block**chain**. Every block that is created is then **chained** to the preceding block, so on and so forth all the way back to Dogecoin’s genesis block. 

In addition to being peer-to-peer and decentralised, another benefit of blockchain technology is that is extremely difficult — and often impossible — to hack, alter, or deceive the system.
