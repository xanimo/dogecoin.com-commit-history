A wallet is necessary for people wanting to trade, use, or ‘hodl’ Dogecoin. There are many ways you can get a wallet, and the best choice of wallet for you is dependent upon the purpose for which you intend to use your Dogecoin. Generally speaking, there are two overarching categories of wallets: 'custodial' and 'non-custodial', depending on whether you are the sole owner of the private keys to your coins. Additionally, wallets can be 'hot' or 'cold', depending on whether they are connected to the Internet or not.

## Custodial Vs Non-Custodial {#custodial-vs-non-custodial-wallets}
A custodial wallet is a wallet where you are not the owner of the private keys to the wallet. Another entity holds the coins on your behalf and manages the private keys. Some exchanges, for example, provide wallet solutions where you do not have direct access to your private keys.

A non-custodial wallet is a wallet where you fully own and control the private keys to your Dogecoin. Dogecoin Core, many smartphone wallets, and hardware wallets are examples of non-custodial wallets. Instead of the keys to your wallet being stored on a centralised server, non-custodial wallets store your private keys locally.

In general, non-custodial wallets are preferrable because you are not relying on centralized third parties to manage your crypto. This is where the popular saying **‘not your keys, not your coins’** comes from.

On the other hand, it’s super important that people who use non-custodial wallets don’t lose their keys or seed phrases. This is why it’s critical for people to [backup their wallet](/dogepedia/articles/how-to-backup-a-wallet), and **why you should never share your seed phrase or private key with anyone you do not trust**.

## Hot Wallets and Cold Wallets {#hot-and-cold-wallets}
In general, a hot wallet is a wallet that is connected to the internet. Examples of hot wallets are Dogecoin Core, browser extension wallets such as MetaMask and the like, and smartphone wallets.

A cold wallet is a wallet that is not connected to the internet. [Hardware wallets](/dogepedia/articles/dogecoin-hardware-wallets) and paper wallets are examples of cold wallets. With these wallets, when properly handled and managed, your private keys are never accessible to the internet. This makes cold wallets inherently safer than hot wallets.

Because of this, non-custodial cold wallets are generally considered to be the safer option for holding your coins, and are typically preferred by people who intend to ‘hodl’ their Dogecoin long-term, or want to keep it especially safe. 

Non-custodial hot wallets, such as smartphone wallets, are normally safe enough to be used for day-to-day expenses and for holding small amounts of Dogecoin.
