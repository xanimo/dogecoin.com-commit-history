A wallet is necessary for people wanting to trade, use, or ‘hodl’ Dogecoin. There are many ways you can get a wallet, and the best choice of wallet for you is dependent upon the purpose for which you intend to use your Dogecoin. Generally speaking, there are two overarching categories of wallets: ‘hot’ wallets and ‘cold’ wallets. Some people use both hot and cold wallets.  

A hot wallet is a wallet that is connected to the internet. Examples of hot wallets are those that are provided by exchanges, or browser extension wallets such as MetaMask and the like. If your wallet is provided by an exchange, be mindful that the keys to this wallet are stored on the exchange’s server. Hot wallets are typically preferred by people who trade and use Dogecoin more frequently. 

A cold wallet is a non-custodial wallet that is not connected to the internet. [Hardware wallets](https://dogecoin.com/dogepedia/articles/dogecoin-hardware-wallets) and paper wallets are examples of cold wallets. Instead of the keys to your wallet being stored on a centralised server, cold wallets utilise physical storage of the keys that are in the user’s possession. This makes cold wallets much more resilient to being hacked or misused. 

Because of this, cold wallets are generally considered to be the safer option for holding your coins, and are typically preferred by people who intend to ‘hodl’ their Dogecoin, or want to keep it especially safe. This is where the popular saying **‘not your keys, not your coins’** comes from.  

It’s super important, though, that people who use cold wallets don’t lose their key or seed phrase. This is why it’s critical for people to [backup their wallet](https://dogecoin.com/dogepedia/articles/how-to-backup-a-wallet), and why you should never share your seed phrase or private key with anyone you do not trust.
