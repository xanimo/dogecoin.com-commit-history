The Dogecoin blockchain consists of thousands of computers running specialised software — called nodes — that result in transaction information being shared and, subsequently, not needing to be stored in one centralised place. 

Dogecoin blockchain information is stored across thousands of nodes, and is why cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin are often referred to as being *decentralised*. 

In short, a node is software that is running on a computer that is connected to the Dogecoin network. This software communicates with other nodes on the network and in doing so keeps the distributed ledger in sync and up-to-date, in addition to providing new nodes that need to download the full Dogecoin blockchain with information about past blocks.  

You, too, can download the software required to run a node via the Dogecoin website [link] or from GitHub [link].
