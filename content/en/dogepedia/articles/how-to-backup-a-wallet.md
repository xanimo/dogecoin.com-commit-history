Every wallet has what is called a *public key* and a *private key*. 

The public key is the wallet’s unique address to which Dogecoin can be sent and stored on the blockchain. 

A wallet’s private key is a randomised 256-bit number unique to your wallet, which can be very lengthy and arduous to remember. This is why human-readable *seed phrases* are often used instead.  

Seed phrases — also called “mnemonic phrases” or “mnemonic seeds” — are derived from your wallet’s private key utilising cryptography and are a sequence of 12 or 24 words. Every seed phrase is unique and identifies the distinct wallet to which Dogecoin is stored. 

It is crucial that you backup your seed phrase because anyone who knows your seed phrase, or private key, will have access to your Dogecoin!

This is why you should never share your seed phrase or private key with anyone that you do not trust. Remember, too, that Dogecoin transactions are permanent. Therefore regularly ‘backing up’ your seed phrase in a safe, secret, and secure location is very important. **It is always more secure to ensure that your seed phrase is not stored on any device that can be connected to the internet.**  

*Remember*: Your wallet’s private key and seed phrase grant the holder access to your Dogecoin – no matter what wallet you use.
