The history of Dogecoin - from Billy and Jackson's quasi-mythical launch to our times, passing through Dogecars and Jamaican bobsled teams, generosity and insanity. Picture of a shibe-historian with a long beard at the top. 

Consult Billy and the current developers, and read through Sporklin's post history, which is a repository on the history of Dogecoin.
